"""SessionStart hook: arm a Monitor to bridge systemd loop fires into this session.

The Phase 1b wake-from-idle bridge for canonical loops scheduled by
systemd-user timers (goal f718156c). The systemd service ExecStart
(`empirica loop tick`) appends one JSON line per fire to
`~/.empirica/loop_fires.log`. This hook tells the running Claude to
arm a persistent Monitor that tails the log and reacts to each event.

Output: hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (string) — markdown
instructions telling Claude exactly which Monitor to arm and how to
react to fire events. Empty output when no enabled loops exist (or
systemd isn't available, or the instance can't be resolved).

Non-blocking — any failure path emits empty output so a missing
systemd doesn't break SessionStart.

## 📬 Empirica orchestration listener — arm at session start

This instance (`{instance_id}`) has canonical loops registered. The
push-primary wake mechanism is `empirica loop listen` — it holds an
authenticated ntfy stream to Cortex and emits one stdout line per
ECO-decided proposal event (real wake) or AI-to-AI completion ack.

### REQUIRED: load mesh skills before your first transaction

Because this session will receive AI-mesh wake events, BOTH messaging
skills MUST be loaded before your first PREFLIGHT:

- `/cortex-mailbox-poll` — receive side: per-direction × per-status
  reaction protocol for incoming `proposal_event` notifications
- `/cortex-mailbox-send` — send side: how to emit proposals, the
  collab vs ECO-gated flavor split, target ai_id verification, AND
  the completion-ack handshake (without which the source AI never
  knows you delivered)

Loading them only when an event arrives is too late — the send-side
handshake guidance is needed BEFORE you act, not after. Load both now.

### Active loops + their body skills

{_build_reaction_table(loop_names)}

**Arm this Monitor at session start:**

```python
Monitor(
    description="Cortex orchestration push listener for {instance_id}",
    command="{monitor_cmd}",
    persistent=True,
)
```

The listener does the right thing on every failure mode: catches up via
content_poll on initial start, on each push arrival, AND on disconnect
+ reconnect. No periodic timer needed — push-primary, poll-on-reconnect-only
("epistemic email for the AI age" — David, 2026-05-15).

**Reaction protocol** — when an event arrives (one JSON line in the chat):

1. Read `direction` field:
   - `inbox` → ECO-decided proposal targeting you (act per status)
   - `outbox` → ack/refinement on a proposal you emitted (informational)
2. **If mid-transaction:** log a goal `"Process <direction>/<status>: <proposal_id>"`
   and pick up at next natural break (EWM pattern).
3. **If idle:** follow the per-direction × per-status reaction protocol
   in the already-loaded `/cortex-mailbox-poll` skill (act on accepted,
   refine on changed, acknowledge on completed). When completing work a
   peer asked of you, ack via the `/cortex-mailbox-send` skill's
   completion-handshake guidance — without it, the source AI never sees
   the work landed.

**ECO-gated autonomy property:** every event you act on traces back to an
ECO actor decision (`eco_actor` field). The listener filters `eco_review`
proposals server-side — they never cross the wake boundary. Even if the
ntfy stream were compromised, your status re-verification against Cortex
by `proposal_id` is the auth boundary.

If you do not arm this Monitor, events will accumulate at Cortex but no
work will trigger in this session. Arming is idempotent (Monitor with
identical command is a no-op the second time).

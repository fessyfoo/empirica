Epistemic Tool Router - UserPromptSubmit Hook

Runs on every user prompt BEFORE Claude starts reasoning. Assesses the task
against the current epistemic state and recommends specific Empirica
tools/agents/skills, influencing Claude's tool selection.

This is the bridge between "what should I do" (VectorRouter modes) and
"what should I use" (specific agents, skills, MCP tools).

Input (stdin JSON):
  {"prompt": "user's prompt text"}

Output (stdout JSON):
  {"continue": true, "context": "routing advice text"}

Performance target: < 2 seconds (runs on every prompt).

# all 3 models passed the decision gate (>=20% improvement on >=2/6 metrics).
# Block is injected LAST in additionalContext to exploit attention recency bias.

# Terse EPP pointer (replaced the full ~21-line block, 2026-07-05, ecodex
# prop_v4tqe4qe / David-directed). The full block was injected on EVERY
# substantive prompt — a per-prompt token cost on every surface, and a visible
# user-role hook-prompt on harnesses that render UserPromptSubmit additionalContext.
# This one-liner names the EPP trigger + the anchor→classify→decide→respond core
# and links the full protocol skill, so the nudge stays on every prompt (no
# false-negative gating risk) at a fraction of the cost. A keyword GATE was the
# alternative but the check is deliberately SEMANTIC, not keyword-based — gating
# the reminder with keywords would miss paraphrase / implicit pushback, the exact

#
# Symptom this block addresses: agent runs 30+ file reads on a question where
# the user already supplied the hypothesis ("might need to create a session",
# "I think it's the X path", "probably the config"). Reading 30 files looks
# diligent but burns context and delays the actual hypothesis-test. The
# proportional response is one targeted probe.
#
# Diagnosis case 2026-05-06: Kimi/Sonnet/Opus all show this pattern in
# ecodex; default-mode bias from upstream training treats every prompt as
# deep-research even when the user's framing is "quick check, I think X".
#
# Trigger detection is regex-based on hypothesis markers + scope-shaping
# verbs. The block doesn't disable investigation — it asks the agent to
# size the probe to the hypothesis BEFORE branching wider.

INVESTIGATION_PROPORTIONALITY_BLOCK = """<investigation-proportionality>
**STOP.** The user's prompt contains a hypothesis marker or
proportional-scope cue ("I think...", "maybe...", "might need...",
"check on...", "verify", "quick look").

**Your FIRST action MUST be the smallest disconfirming probe** — a
single bash / grep / read that would prove the user's hypothesis wrong
if wrong, or confirm a key prediction if right. Not a survey. Not a
mental model. One probe.

Required sequence:
1. **NAME the hypothesis** in your reply (one sentence: "Hypothesis: X").
2. **RUN the disconfirming probe** as your next tool call.
3. ONLY IF the probe disconfirms or surfaces a new question, expand
   investigation. Otherwise, answer.

**Hard rule:** the Sentinel firewall is now armed. After 5 read/grep/glob
tool calls without naming a hypothesis and running a probe, further
investigation tools will be DENIED with the same reasoning. This is
not a soft suggestion — it's a runtime constraint. Survey-mode is
explicitly blocked here because the user already gave you the
hypothesis to test.

Anti-patterns this block kills:
- Reading the entire subsystem to verify a one-line config change.
- Running grep across the codebase before checking if the answer is in
  the user's own message.
- Building a mental model of code you haven't touched, when one command
  would tell you which path to look at.

This is NOT a ban on thorough work — depth is fine AFTER the probe.
The discipline is "test first, expand on evidence", not "skim and
assume". When you genuinely need to map an unfamiliar subsystem, the
prompt won't trigger this block. When the user hands you a hypothesis,
test it.

"""
Empirica Sentinel Gate - Noetic Firewall with Epistemic ACLs

Implements least-privilege principle for AI tool access:
- NOETIC tools (read/investigate) → always allowed
- PRAXIC tools (write/execute) → require PREFLIGHT, auto-proceed if confident

This is essentially iptables for cognition - default deny, explicit allow.

Core features (always on):
- Smart project root discovery (env var, known paths, cwd search)
- Noetic tool whitelist (Read, Grep, Glob, etc.)
- Safe Bash command whitelist (ls, cat, git status, etc.)
- PREFLIGHT required for praxic actions (epistemic assessment)
- AUTO-PROCEED: If PREFLIGHT vectors pass dynamic threshold gate, skip CHECK
- LOW-CONFIDENCE: If PREFLIGHT fails gate, explicit CHECK required
- Decision parsing (blocks if CHECK returned "investigate")

Optional features (off by default):
- EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_REQUIRE_BOOTSTRAP=true - Require project-bootstrap before praxic
- EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_COMPACT_INVALIDATION=true - Invalidate CHECK after compact
- EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_CHECK_EXPIRY=true - Enable 30-minute CHECK expiry
- EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_LOOPING=false - Disable sentinel entirely

Related but NOT consumed here:
- EMPIRICA_CALIBRATION_FEEDBACK=false - Suppress calibration feedback in workflow
  output (PREFLIGHT/CHECK enrichment). Does NOT affect gating — the Sentinel always
  uses raw vectors. See workflow_commands.py for where this flag is consumed.

"""Epistemic source tagging for artifacts (source-aware Sentinel substrate).

Per docs/architecture/PROMPT_FOR_EMPIRICA_CLAUDE_source_aware_sentinel.md.

Every finding/decision/unknown/mistake/assumption/dead-end can be tagged
with how the AI arrived at it:

- ``intuition``  — generated from training data + already-loaded session
  context, no external retrieval since the goal opened.
- ``search``     — produced or substantially shaped by an external retrieval
  this session (file read, grep, glob, web fetch, MCP tool call,
  project_search, etc.).
- ``mixed``      — both intuition and search contributed.
- ``None``       — legacy / not yet tagged. Default for back-compat.

The Sentinel uses per-goal source ratios as a calibration signal: vectors
asserted high ``know`` while every artifact is ``intuition``-tagged is
exactly the gaming surface ecodex's brief identifies.

This is v0 — the data primitive only. The routing rule (gate route to
"investigate" when claims are high but evidence is all-intuition) is
deferred until calibration history accumulates.

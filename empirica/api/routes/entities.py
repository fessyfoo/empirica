"""Entity mint endpoint — daemon HTTP surface over the workspace entity registry.

POST /api/v1/entities mints a contact into workspace.db entity_registry,
idempotently: re-creating with the same identity (email first, then the
deterministic name/company slug) returns the existing entity_id with
created=false. The returned id is the canonical contact_id that external
consumers (e.g. a CRM MCP server on the same box) carry as their FK and
that the knowledge-graph traversal resolves.

On a loopback daemon no bearer auth is enforced (transport security is the
loopback boundary, consistent with the other /api/v1 routes). When the per-org
daemon binds non-loopback (the hosted deployment), the route is guarded by a
service-token bearer — see ``empirica.api.entity_mint_auth``. The guard is a
route dependency, so the mint contract body is unchanged; auth rides the
``Authorization`` header (401 on missing/invalid token).

"""Daemon active-project resolver.

Resolves which Empirica project the `empirica serve` daemon is bound to. Held
for the daemon's process lifetime — user restarts the daemon to switch projects
(matches existing project-switch CLI semantics for transient commands; daemon's
long-running nature makes per-call re-resolution unnecessary).

Resolution chain (high-to-low precedence):
  1. **`InstanceResolver.project_path()`** — the canonical resolver. Picks up
     instance_projects/{instance_id}.json (P0), active_work_{uuid}.json (P1),
     headless active_work.json (P2). This handles the case where the daemon
     is launched in a tmux pane sibling to an active CC instance, or in a
     terminal where project-switch has set context.
  2. **CWD walk-up** for `.empirica/project.yaml` — daemon-specific tail for
     the case "user launches `empirica serve` in a project tree without any
     active CC context" (e.g., fresh terminal, headless launch). The canonical
     resolver intentionally fails-fast on this case because guessing CWD for
     transient CLI commands risks polluting other instances; for a daemon
     bound to one project, walking up from CWD is correct.
  3. **None** — daemon starts but per-project endpoints return 503.

Per docs/architecture/instance_isolation/: *NOT* adding a competing resolver
chain. Step 1 IS the canonical chain; step 2 is the daemon-specific tail
that canonical fails-fast on by design.

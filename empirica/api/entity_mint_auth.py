"""Service-token guard for the hosted entity-mint endpoint.

Guards ``POST /api/v1/entities`` (the ``b068bedfd`` contact mint) when the
per-org ``empirica serve`` daemon binds beyond loopback — the hosted-daemon
deployment on Hetzner/EU. Self-hosted loopback daemons stay auth-free, so
same-box consumers (e.g. a CRM MCP server) are unaffected.

Co-spec: ``empirica-mesh-support/docs/entity-mint-service-token-spec.md``.
Consumers: cortex OAuth P3 ``get_or_create_user``, crm-mcp (NLE CRM round-trip).

Model — shared-secret, deliberately NOT JWT:
  - Tokens are opaque ``emk_<urlsafe>`` bearers minted by cortex (the credential
    authority). Empirica validates by constant-time string-equality against a
    locally-configured *valid-token set* — no introspection round-trip back to
    cortex, so the mint path stays fast and uncoupled.
  - Empirica owns the SET (and the rotation overlap window); a consumer carries
    only its one *current* token. Rotation is zero-downtime: add ``emk_new`` to
    the set, consumers switch their single env, then drop ``emk_old``.
  - Forward hook (unified-auth migration): swap ``verify_mint_bearer`` for JWT
    signature verification against the unified-auth server's public key. One
    function to replace, no parallel shared-secret+JWT path to unwind.

Activation + fail-closed:
  - The guard enforces whenever a valid-token set is configured.
  - ``assert_bind_safe`` refuses startup when bound non-loopback with no token
    configured — the mint is never exposed unauthed.

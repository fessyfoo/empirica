Epistemic Artifact Deprecation System

and relevance scoring to prevent bootstrap bloat at scale.

Key insight: Not all findings are equally relevant. Recent high-impact
findings should be prioritized, while old low-impact findings fade.

        Exponential time-decay weight: exp(-age_days / tau).

        Base tau = 30 days (e-folding time, ~21-day half-life: 30d -> 0.37,
        90d -> 0.05). NOTE: this is the e-folding constant, not the half-life —
        the earlier docstring claiming "30d -> 0.5" was wrong.

        Longevity modulation (David-locked, decay thread prop_j7y7f4): when
        `longevity` is given, high-longevity artifacts get a longer tau so
        durable knowledge does not fade like tactical noise:
            tau = 30 * (1 + 2*longevity)   # 0->30d, 0.5->60d, 1.0->90d
        The longevity modulator is impact for findings, and confidence for
        lessons/eidetic facts (a well-established fact stays relevant longer).
        e.g. a longevity-0.9 artifact: 30d->0.70, 90d->0.34, 180d->0.12.

        When `longevity` is None the curve is flat (current behaviour) — used by
        calculate_relevance_score, which already weights impact separately and
        must NOT double-count it here.

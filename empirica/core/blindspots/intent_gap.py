"""Intent-gap blindspot detection — the least-noisy signal.

A blindspot is *absent + unacknowledged + inferred*. The strongest, lowest-noise
inference is against **stated intent**: a goal/task the practice declared it would
address, that has no covering artifact AND no acknowledging unknown. You said
you'd assess X; nothing shows you did; you never flagged X as open.

Pure function over ``GoalDataRepository.get_goal_tree(session_id)`` — no DB, no
embeddings, unit-testable. The per-subtask ``findings`` / ``unknowns`` /
``dead_ends`` lists ARE the mask:

- a **finding** means it's covered → not a blindspot
- an **unknown** means it's acknowledged → a known-unknown, not a blindspot
- a **dead_end** means it was attempted → not an untouched gap

so a candidate is an *open* subtask, under a *non-terminal* goal, with all three
empty.

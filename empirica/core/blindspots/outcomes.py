"""Blindspot outcome resolution — the POSTFLIGHT learning half (T4).

Closes the loop the CHECK advisory opened: a surfaced blindspot is advanced to
``acknowledged`` (its flagged task got engaged) or ``dismissed`` (the goal closed
with the task still bare — you proceeded past the nudge). That makes
``blindspot-report``'s acknowledge/dismiss rates real, which is what tunes how
loud the detector earns the right to be.

``regretted`` — the training label (a *dismissed* blindspot that later became a
mistake/dead-end) — is applied automatically by ``apply_blindspot_regret`` at
POSTFLIGHT (goal-level correlation, causally ordered); ``mark_blindspot_regretted``
is the direct-subtask primitive it and callers use.

All fail-open — the blindspot machinery must never affect POSTFLIGHT.

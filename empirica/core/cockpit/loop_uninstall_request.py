"""Cockpit→Claude loop uninstall requests.

Symmetric inverse of `loop_install_request`. When a loop is paused, the
empirica CLI can clear `next_scheduled_job_id` from the registry but it
*can't* call CronDelete itself — that's a Claude Code tool, not a shell
command. Result, pre-fix: the OS cron table still has the recurring job
queued, so it keeps firing every interval, spawning fresh CC sessions
that run the body just long enough to see the pause flag and exit.
Pause was advisory.

The bridge: write a "pending uninstall request" file. A UserPromptSubmit
hook on the owning instance surfaces the pending request as a
`<system-reminder>` (via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`) on the
next prompt. The owning Claude reads the system-reminder and runs
`CronDelete(<job_id>)` from inside that CC session. The cron is gone,
the loop is genuinely off.

Pending file path:
  ~/.empirica/loop_uninstall_pending_{instance_id}_{name}.json

Each file contains:
  {
    "instance_id": "tmux_3",
    "name": "metrics-watch",
    "job_id": "cron-create-abc123",
    "scheduler_kind": "cron-create",
    "requested_at": "2026-04-30T20:30:00Z",
    "requested_by": "tmux_7",   # the instance that issued pause
    "reason": "manual pause"     # short label for the reminder
  }

The hook reads pending files for the running instance, surfaces them,
then deletes them. Idempotent — re-pausing just rewrites the file.

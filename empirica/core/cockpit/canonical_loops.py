"""System-level canonical loop catalog.

When the TUI cockpit user toggles L (loops) on an instance that has no
loops registered AND no `.empirica/project.yaml` `cockpit.loops` block,
fall back to this catalog — empirica ships a sane default that wires
each empirica claude into the orchestration mesh out of the box.

## Design

Entries are dicts matching the same shape `project_loops` returns
(see `project_cockpit_config.py`):

    {
      "name": str,           # required, unique per instance
      "kind": "interval" | "cron" | "monitor",
      "interval": str,        # for kind=interval (base when backoff is set)
      "cron": str,            # for kind=cron
      "description": str,
      "base_interval": str,   # optional backoff floor
      "max_interval": str,    # optional backoff ceiling
    }

The body (what the AI does when the loop fires) is NOT stored here —
it lives in a companion skill the AI loads on fire. The `description`
field is the one-line summary surfaced in the TUI; the skill name is
implied by the loop name where applicable.

## Adaptive cadence model

Loops are adaptive — every entry has `base_interval` (fast) and
`max_interval` (idle). The runtime adjusts:

- **Self-throttle**: if the AI has an open empirica transaction, the
  loop body returns immediately. Caller is already engaged — no need
  to interrupt for an inbox poll.
- **Backoff on no-op**: if a poll returns nothing new, the next
  interval grows toward `max_interval` (exponential by convention).
- **Reset on activity**: any non-empty poll resets to `base_interval`.

## Adding entries

This is a curated catalog. Each entry should be:
- General-purpose enough that any empirica claude benefits
- Self-contained (the body in the companion skill should not assume
  project-specific config beyond `~/.empirica/credentials.yaml`)
- Cheap when idle (backoff to max_interval should be tolerable)

For project-specific loops, use `.empirica/project.yaml` cockpit.loops
instead — project config takes precedence over this catalog.

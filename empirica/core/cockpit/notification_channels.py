"""Notification-channels discovery — cockpit's wire to cortex's per-tenant topic registry.

Per cortex's ECO_COLLAB_RESCOPE Phase 4 (prop_oe7jz5...) the bare
`orchestration-events` ntfy topic was deprecated in favour of
org-prefixed topics (e.g. `empirica-orchestration-events`). T16/T17
tightened isolation further so the channel registry is now per-tenant
(each tenant's `/v1/users/me/notification-channels` returns the topic
keyed for THAT tenant's wake stream). Cortex runs dual-emit during
the transition; once Phase 5 lands, only the
prefixed topic will be live and listeners hardcoded to bare break.

This module queries cortex for the canonical topic names so the
listener defaults to the per-tenant shape automatically — no
env-var override needed, no version-pinned hardcoded topic.

## Endpoint (cortex side)

  GET /v1/users/me/notification-channels
      → {channels: [{topic: str, kind: str, ...}], system_topic: str}

Each `channels[i].topic` is the fully-resolved topic name cortex
wants THIS caller (tenant-scoped post-T16/T17) to subscribe to — e.g.
`empirica-orchestration-events` for the org-shared topic, or a
tenant-keyed variant where cortex has narrowed isolation further.
Filtering by AI is still done with the `?tags=<ai_id>` suffix at
subscription time.

## No silent bare fallback (legacy topic killed — 2026-06)

The bare `orchestration-events` topic has NO ntfy ACL grant for
non-admin users, so subscribing to it 403s on every poll. Worse, the
old resolver fell back to it *silently* whenever it couldn't find an
explicit `orchestration-events` channel in the endpoint payload — and
cortex's payload never contained one (it lists eco/collab/system/
publish/roster, keyed by `category` not `kind`). Net effect: the whole
fleet silently pinned to the dead bare topic, generating a 403 storm,
while the per-org migration looked "complete".

So the resolver now DERIVES the per-org prefix from the sibling
channels cortex DOES return (all fully `<org>-` prefixed, e.g.
`empirica-system`) and constructs `<org>-orchestration-events`. If the
endpoint is genuinely unreachable / returns nothing prefixable, it
RAISES rather than silently subscribing to the dead bare topic — the
caller surfaces a clean error instead of registering a 403-ing
listener.

## Cache

5-minute TTL — topic names rarely change, and the resolver is called
on every `empirica listener on` invocation. Cache is module-level
state, reset via `reset_cache()` in tests.

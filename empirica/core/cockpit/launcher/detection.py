"""Abnormal-exit detection for the cockpit launcher.

Compares ``last_session_start`` mtime against ``last_clean_shutdown``
mtime + checks the active.lock PID. Three outcomes:
  - ``None`` — last shutdown was clean (start ≤ clean) OR no session
    has ever been launched
  - ``SessionAlreadyRunning`` — start > clean AND the locked PID is
    alive (cockpit is currently running, not abnormal)
  - ``AbnormalExit`` — start > clean AND no live PID. The cockpit
    died without writing a clean-shutdown marker.

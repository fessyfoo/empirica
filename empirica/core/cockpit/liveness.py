"""Liveness detection for cockpit instances.

An instance is "alive" when there is reason to believe an actual Claude
Code process is running in it. Otherwise the cockpit shouldn't list it
by default — `kill` would just say "already dead", and the row is noise.

Signal hierarchy (first definitive signal wins):

  1. tmux instance: `tmux list-panes -a` includes %N → maybe alive (continue);
     %N missing → DEAD (terminal closed, Claude is gone with it).
  2. Captured PPID alive: os.kill(ppid, 0) succeeds → ALIVE.
     PPID dead → DEAD (Claude process exited).
  3. No PID and no tmux info, but recent activity (< RECENT_ACTIVITY_S):
     → ALIVE (likely fresh session that hasn't synced yet).
  4. Otherwise → DEAD.

A consequence: a tmux pane that exists but contains a plain shell where
Claude exited will show DEAD if we have a captured PPID — exactly the
case David flagged.

The tmux pane query is cached per-call to avoid spawning a subprocess per
instance during a status sweep.

    The process-scan signals (2, 4) are the fix for non-tmux multiplexers

    restarts: a Claude that is genuinely running but is neither the tmux pane
    foreground nor has a *live* captured PID is still detectable in the process
    table. Signal 2 (env) is exact; signal 4 (cwd) is a coarse fallback. Both
    are ALIVE-positive only — absence is never a dead verdict, so they never
    override a definitive negative.

    The earlier shape short-circuited on tmux: if a pane existed but
    Claude was not the foreground command (e.g. user temporarily at
    bash, claude-in-a-split, wrapper script holding the foreground),
    is_alive returned DEAD without ever checking the captured PID.
    Philipp reported the symptom on his machine — 10 Claude PIDs
    alive via ``ps`` but only 1 visible in the cockpit. The fix is
    structural: tmux disagreement is no longer a verdict. The PID
    check is a parallel definitive signal, and the cockpit reports
    DEAD only when every signal agrees the process is gone.

    Args:
        instance_id: the instance to check
        last_activity_seconds: seconds since most recent state-file write
        live_panes: pre-computed set of live tmux pane numbers (sweep

        current_instance_id: if equal to instance_id, treat as alive

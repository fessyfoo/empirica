"""ntfy listener — push-primary wake mechanism for canonical loops.

Holds an authenticated HTTP stream to cortex's ntfy topic. Each message
arrival is a wake signal — the listener doesn't TRUST the message content
itself (defense in depth + ECO-gated autonomy property). Instead, on every
ntfy event arrival the listener triggers a catch-up content_poll which
fetches the authoritative ECO-decided state from Cortex via the existing
T6/T7 path and emits content events.

Why this shape:

  1. **Push-primary**: zero idle cost when nothing's happening; ~100ms
     wake latency when a real event lands. No periodic timer firing in
     the background ("nag not nudge" — David, 2026-05-15).

  2. **Reconnect-triggers-catch-up**: when the held connection drops
     (network blip, laptop sleep, server restart, ntfy bug), the
     listener reconnects and immediately runs ONE catch-up poll. Any
     events missed during the drop window are captured by the poll's
     diff-against-last-seen logic. No events leak.

  3. **ntfy as wake-pinger, not content source**: the listener treats
     ntfy messages as opaque wake signals. Authoritative content comes
     from the Cortex inbox/outbox catch-up. This means even if ntfy is
     compromised, the AI's reaction is bounded by what Cortex actually
     returns — preserving the ECO-gated authorization boundary.

Each event line written to stdout is one Monitor event in the running
Claude session (the SessionStart hook arms Monitor on this command's
stdout). Lines are JSON, matching ProposalEvent's wire shape so the
existing reaction protocol handles them uniformly.

Failure modes handled:

  - Connection drop / network blip → reconnect with exponential backoff
    (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → max 60s). Catch-up poll on every reconnect.
  - Auth failure (401/403) → log error to stderr, sleep 5min, retry
    (creds may rotate; don't pin to a permanent failure).
  - ntfy keepalive messages → silently ignored (they're proof-of-life,
    not content).
  - SIGTERM / SIGINT → exit cleanly so systemd / Monitor lifecycle
    knows the listener stopped intentionally.

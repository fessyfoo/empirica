"""Content-aware loop tick body for cortex-mailbox-poll.

Replaces the heartbeat model ("fire every 30s, AI decides whether to act")
with a content-aware model ("poll Cortex, emit only when ECO-decided content
arrived or changed status").

## ECO-gated autonomy property

This module is the security/architecture pivot for canonical loops:

  - The systemd timer fires this poll every N seconds. The timer is
    mechanism — easy to hijack at the OS layer.
  - The poll fetches `/v1/orchestration/inbox?status=accepted,changed,declined`
    — only proposals ECO (David, via phone/extension) has decided on.
  - Diffs against last-seen state. Emits one line per new-or-changed proposal.
  - The AI's wake signal carries a `proposal_id` — the action authorization
    traces back to an ECO decision. Hijacking the timer can't widen the
    AI's authority because any forged event points at a proposal_id whose
    status the AI re-verifies with Cortex (which only returns ECO-decided
    state).

If the timer is silent (no new content), the AI stays idle — zero token
cost. If a malicious actor injects events into the fires log, the AI's
verification step against Cortex catches them.

## State file

`~/.empirica/loop_state/<inst>_<loop>.json`:

    {
      "last_poll_ts": "2026-05-15T20:00:00+00:00",
      "proposals": {
        "prop_xyz": {"status": "accepted", "seen_at": "2026-05-15T19:51:53Z"},
        "prop_abc": {"status": "changed",  "seen_at": "2026-05-15T19:30:00Z"}
      }
    }

## Bootstrap behavior

On first run (state file absent), the listener now emits all proposals
that pass the EMISSION_STATUSES filter — those are already the meaningful
wake events (accepted/changed/declined for inbox; changed/declined/completed
for outbox). The earlier "record without emit" policy was overcautious:
it prevented historical-flood, but also lost wake events for unacked
proposals pending at install time (the test case David hit 2026-05-16
when pressing Events on a fresh instance that had already-accepted
proposals in inbox). The AI's reaction protocol is idempotent
(re-verifies each proposal_id against Cortex) so a one-time emit of
~dozen items at bootstrap is benign.

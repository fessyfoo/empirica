"""suggest_links_for_artifact — semantic neighbour candidates after *-log.

Called by the 6 *-log command handlers (finding, unknown, dead-end,
mistake, assumption, decision) right after Qdrant auto-embed completes.
Returns top-K semantically similar existing artifacts so the AI can
anchor edges via `--related-to <id>` (single-link) or a follow-up
`log-artifacts` graph batch (multi-link).

Closes the 'AI doesn't think to link artifacts' gap that the v0.5
substrate measures via edges_with_artifacts in the retrospective.

Graceful degradation: returns [] if Qdrant unreachable, embedding
fails, or no neighbours clear the similarity threshold.

Backwards compat: legacy Qdrant payloads (embedded before the
artifact_id field was added) are resolved via a SQLite reverse-hash
map — every artifact UUID in the project is md5-hashed once and
matched against the Qdrant point_id of each hit.

"""Tests for project_resolver.resolve_project_id raise-instead-of-sys.exit refactor.

Pre-fix: resolve_project_id called sys.exit(1) on miss. SystemExit derives
from BaseException (not Exception), so library callers (POSTFLIGHT
pipeline stages and similar) couldn't catch it via `except Exception`,
and the process died — taking down POSTFLIGHT mid-pipeline. See #95
(pschwinger) for the live repro.

Post-fix: resolve_project_id raises ProjectNotFoundError (a normal
Exception subclass). Library callers can catch and recover. Top-level
CLI handlers' existing `except Exception` paths print the error and
exit cleanly via the standard handle_cli_error pipeline.

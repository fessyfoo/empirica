"""Tests for InstanceResolver.ai_id(project_path=...) — explicit-path mode
that bypasses the resolver chain for callers iterating known paths
(cockpit per-instance ai_id, project_init at provisioning time).

Strict-canonical convention: basename derivation returns the **exact**
directory name with the `empirica-` prefix KEPT. Short aliases
(`cortex`, `mesh-support`) live in human-conversational layers only;
code paths must use the full basename so cortex routing + ntfy event
filtering line up. Pre-strict-canonical the resolver stripped the
prefix and caused silent mesh wake drops (cortex's prop_5egdlfyq4r).

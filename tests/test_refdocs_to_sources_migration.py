"""Tests for migration 046 (refdocs → sources) + the dual reader/writer.

Phase 1 of goal 3d6aeb08 (deprecate refdocs, full migration to sources
with source_type='pointer'):

  - Writer (`add_reference_doc`) now inserts into `epistemic_sources`
    with `source_type='pointer'` instead of `project_reference_docs`.
  - Reader (`get_project_reference_docs`) queries the same source-type
    and projects the row back into the legacy refdoc shape so existing
    consumers (bootstrap formatter, extension renderer) see no behavior
    change.
  - Migration 046 backfills any rows that exist in the legacy table.

These tests exercise: writer routes to sources, reader returns the
right shape, migration is idempotent, mixed (new + migrated) reads
work, and consumer-facing fields (doc_path, doc_type, doc_data) are
preserved across the unification.

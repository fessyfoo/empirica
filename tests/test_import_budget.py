"""Import-budget gate — hot-path entry points must not eagerly pull heavy deps.

Every `empirica <cmd>` pays `import empirica.cli`; the serve daemon pays
`import empirica.api.serve_app` on the `/health` hot path. Eagerly importing a
heavy dependency at module-load there taxes *every* invocation — and twice this
session it has bitten us:

  - #116: serve `/health` pulled `empirica.core.qdrant.embeddings`, which
    eagerly imported the openai SDK (~0.5s), tripping the 3.11 health-wait.
  - #119: the CLI pulled httpx (~190ms) + GitPython (~140ms).

Both were fixed by making those imports lazy. This is the forward-looking gate.

**The budget** is `_BUDGET`: per hot-path entry point, the set of heavy modules
it is *allowed* to pull (its real framework). Everything else in `_HEAVY` is
forbidden. A new heavy import in a hot path fails here; widening the budget is
then a deliberate, reviewed decision visible in the diff — a ratchet, not an
absolute bar.

**Presence-based, not time-based.** Import *time* is flaky on shared CI runners;
the *cause* we actually want to forbid (a heavy module landing in `sys.modules`)
is deterministic. So the budget is "which heavy modules loaded", measured in a
fresh subprocess. Runs in the normal suite → gates both CI and `release --prepare`.

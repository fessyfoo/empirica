"""The finding-log immune-system decay helpers are DISABLED (2026-05-28).

Both previously fired on relatedness (keyword overlap / cosine similarity),
not actual contradiction, so a confirmatory finding decayed the fact/lesson it
confirmed (autoimmune). Until a real opposition predicate exists (goal 98055360
P2, converged w/ cortex on decay thread prop_j7y7f4), finding-log must NOT
auto-decay. These tests guard against accidental re-enable without the predicate.

The helpers early-return before any Qdrant / cold-storage I/O, so inputs that
would previously have triggered decay must now produce no-ops regardless.

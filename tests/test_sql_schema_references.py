"""Catch a recurring bug class: static SQL that references a non-existent column/table.

THE BUG CLASS
-------------
A static SQL query in the codebase names a column or table that does not exist
in the real schema. At runtime SQLite raises ``OperationalError: no such column``
(or ``no such table``), but the call site wraps the query in a broad
``try/except`` that swallows the error. The feature then silently no-ops while
every health surface looks green — the failure is invisible until someone
notices the feature has been dead for an unknown duration.

A live example: ``SELECT meta FROM reflexes`` where the actual column is
``reflex_data``. That single typo made a whole feature dead for an unknown
duration, with no log, no test failure, no red badge — exactly because the
surrounding ``except`` ate the ``OperationalError``.

WHAT THIS TEST DOES
-------------------
1. Builds the *real* schema (session DB + workspace DB) in an in-memory SQLite
   connection by running the actual production schema builders.
2. AST-walks every ``.py`` under ``empirica/`` and extracts every *static*
   SQL string passed to ``.execute()`` / ``.executemany()`` / ``.executescript()``.
   Dynamic queries (f-strings, ``.format()``, ``%``, concatenation, name refs)
   are SKIPPED on purpose — interpolating identifiers from internal allow-lists
   is a known-correct pattern, and we cannot resolve them statically.
3. Validates each static DML query against the real schema using SQLite's own
   parser via ``EXPLAIN`` (no third-party SQL parser is used or added).
4. Asserts no query references a missing column or table.

KNOWN LIMITATION — migration drift
----------------------------------
This test builds the *fresh* schema (all CREATE TABLE + all migrations applied).
It therefore catches columns missing from the fresh schema, but NOT the
migration-drift variant: a column that exists in the fresh schema but is absent
from an older long-lived DB that never received a particular migration (e.g.
``impact`` on ``project_dead_ends`` on a DB created before that column was
added). Detecting that requires comparing against migrated long-lived DBs,
which is out of scope here.

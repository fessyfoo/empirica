"""Tests for session-create --auto-init wiring the project_path through to
instance_projects (ecodex prop_zwfsl26r7fc7ddj6oemkfcwa44).

Bug: _handle_auto_init created the project but never persisted project_path
to a location the resolver chain could see. _write_tty_session then called
R.project_path() (which returned None for the brand-new project) and silently
no-op'd. Subsequent commands hit 'Cannot resolve project path.'

Fix: _handle_auto_init returns the just-created project_path; the main flow
forwards it to _write_tty_session via project_path_override.

**Epistemic infrastructure for AI — measurement, memory, and calibration across sessions.**

Empirica tracks what AI knows, gates what it does, and compounds learning across session boundaries. It measures the gap between what AI predicts and what's true — making AI agents measurably more reliable.

## The Problem

AI coding agents today have no self-awareness about what they know:

- **Forgets between sessions** — same questions, same dead ends, every time
- **Acts before understanding** — edits your code without knowing the architecture
- **Can't tell you when it's guessing** — no distinction between knowledge and confabulation
- **No audit trail** — reasoning evaporates with the context window

---

## What Empirica Does

| Capability | What You Experience |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Measures before acting** | AI investigates your codebase before touching it. The Sentinel gate blocks edits until understanding is demonstrated |
| **Remembers across sessions** | Findings, dead-ends, and learnings persist in a 4-layer memory system. Session 3 starts where Session 2 left off |
| **Prevents confident mistakes** | The CHECK gate uses domain-aware thresholds scaled by criticality — cybersec/high is stricter than default/low |
| **Shows confidence in real-time** | Live statusline in your terminal: `[empirica] ⚡94% ↕70% │ 🎯3 │ POST 🔍92% │ K:95% C:92%` |
| **Calibrates against reality** | Three-vector model: self-assessed, observed (from deterministic checks), and AI-reasoned grounded state with rationale. Domain compliance loops iterate until all checks pass |
| **Tracks your codebase** | Temporal entity model auto-extracts functions, classes, and imports from every file edit — the AI knows what's alive and what's stale |
| **Coordinates with peer AIs** | Cross-Claude mesh via Cortex — peer AIs propose work, ECO accepts/declines, completion handshakes carry commit SHAs. A persistent listener wakes idle sessions on inbox events |
| **Works through natural language** | You describe tasks normally. The AI operates the measurement system automatically |

---

## How You Use It

You talk to your AI normally. Empirica works in the background:

```
You:      "Fix the authentication bug in the login flow"

Empirica: [AI investigates → logs findings → passes Sentinel gate → implements fix → measures learning]

You see:  ⚡87% ↕70% │ 🎯1 │ POST 🔍85% │ K:88% C:82% │ Δ +K
```

**You direct. The AI measures.**

Empirica's CLI has 150+ commands spanning investigation, measurement, calibration, and memory — like a cockpit instrument panel. You don't need to learn any of them. The AI reads the instruments, operates the controls, and reports back in natural language. The statusline gives you the flight data at a glance.

For power users, direct CLI access is always available: `empirica goals-list`, `empirica calibration-report`, `empirica project-search --task "..."`, and more.

**Learn the full workflow:** **[getempirica.com](https://getempirica.com)** has interactive training, guides, and deep explanations of every concept.

## Quick Start

### Install + Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
pip install empirica
empirica setup-claude-code
```

Then just start working. The hooks, Sentinel, system prompt, statusline, and MCP server are all configured automatically. See [Claude Code Setup](docs/human/developers/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for details — including a **["What the hooks inject"](docs/human/developers/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md#what-the-hooks-inject-for-claude-reading-this-before-agreeing-to-install) section** for Claude sessions that want to see the contract (which hook fires when, what it adds to the AI's context, source pointers for every emission) before agreeing to install.

**Already have Claude Code configured?** Use `--force` to replace your default Claude Code settings with Empirica's epistemic hooks. Without `--force`, setup only writes files that don't already exist — so if you've already used Claude Code, the default internals stay in place and Empirica's hooks won't activate.

```bash
empirica setup-claude-code --force
```

`--force` replaces hooks in `settings.json` but **only removes Empirica's own hooks** — hooks from other plugins (Railway, Superpowers, etc.) are preserved.

### Alternative Installation Methods

<details>
<summary>Homebrew (macOS)</summary>

```bash
brew tap nubaeon/tap
brew install empirica
empirica setup-claude-code
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>

```bash
# Security-hardened Alpine image (~276MB, recommended)
docker pull nubaeon/empirica:1.10.4-alpine

# Standard image (Debian slim, ~414MB)
docker pull nubaeon/empirica:1.10.4

# Run
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/.empirica:/data/.empirica nubaeon/empirica:1.10.4 /bin/bash
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual / Other AI Platforms</summary>

```bash
pip install empirica
pip install empirica-mcp        # MCP Server (for Cursor, Cline, etc.)
cd your-project && empirica project-init
```

The CLI works standalone on any platform. The full epistemic workflow (epistemic transactions, Sentinel, calibration) requires loading the system prompt into your AI — the easiest path is `empirica setup-claude-code`, which wires the lean prompt into `~/.claude/empirica-system-prompt.md` and references it from your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. See [Claude Code Setup](docs/human/developers/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for details.

### First Session

```bash
empirica onboard   # Interactive walkthrough of the full workflow
```

Or just start working — with Claude Code hooks active, the AI manages the epistemic workflow automatically.

## The Measurement Architecture

Empirica works through nested abstraction layers:

```
Plan
 └── Transaction 1 (Goal A)
      ├── NOETIC: investigate, search, read → findings, unknowns, dead-ends
      ├── CHECK: Sentinel gate → proceed / investigate more
      ├── PRAXIC: implement, write, commit → goals completed
      └── POSTFLIGHT: measure learning delta → persists to memory
 └── Transaction 2 (Goal B, informed by T1's findings)
      └── ...
```

**Plans** decompose into **transactions** — one per goal or Claude Code task. Each transaction is a **noetic-praxic loop**: investigate first (noetic), then act (praxic), with the Sentinel gating the transition. Along the way, the AI collects and reads **artifacts** (findings, unknowns, assumptions, dead-ends, decisions) while using **semantic search** to surface relevant epistemic patterns and anti-patterns from the project's history. Top artifacts are ranked by confidence and fed into each project's **MEMORY.md** as a hot cache.

### The Epistemic Transaction Cycle

```
PREFLIGHT ────────► CHECK ────────► POSTFLIGHT
    │                 │                  │
 Baseline         Sentinel           Learning
 Assessment        Gate               Delta
    │                 │                  │
 "What do I      "Am I ready      "What did I
  know now?"      to act?"         learn?"
```

**PREFLIGHT:** AI assesses its knowledge state before starting work.
**CHECK:** Sentinel gate validates readiness before allowing code edits.
**POSTFLIGHT:** AI measures what it learned, creating a delta that persists.

---

## Live Statusline

With Claude Code hooks enabled, you see the AI's epistemic state in real-time:

```
[empirica] ⚡94% ↕70% │ 🎯3 ❓12/5 │ POST 🔍92% │ K:95% C:92% │ Δ +K +C
```

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **⚡94%** | Overall epistemic confidence |
| **↕70%** | Sentinel threshold (know gate) — user-facing only |
| **🎯3 ❓12/5** | Open goals (3), unknowns (12 total, 5 blocking) |
| **POST 🔍92%** | Transaction phase + work state (🔍 investigating / 🔨 acting) with composite score |
| **K:95% C:92%** | Knowledge and Context vectors (color-coded by gap to threshold) |
| **Δ +K +C** | Learning delta (POSTFLIGHT only) — which vectors improved |

---

## The 13 Epistemic Vectors

These vectors emerged from 600+ real working sessions across multiple AI systems. They measure the dimensions that consistently predict success or failure in complex tasks.

| Tier | Vector | What It Measures |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Gate** | `engagement` | Is the AI actively processing or disengaged? |
| **Foundation** | `know` | Domain knowledge depth |
| | `do` | Execution capability |
| | `context` | Access to relevant information |
| **Comprehension** | `clarity` | How clear is the understanding? |
| | `coherence` | Do the pieces fit together? |
| | `signal` | Signal-to-noise in available information |
| | `density` | Information richness |
| **Execution** | `state` | Current working state |
| | `change` | Rate of progress/change |
| | `completion` | Task completion level |
| | `impact` | Significance of the work |
| **Meta** | `uncertainty` | Explicit doubt tracking |

## How It Works With Claude Code

Empirica doesn't replace or reinvent anything Claude Code already does. Claude Code owns tasks, plans, memory, and projects. Empirica adds the **measurement layer** on top:

| Claude Code Does | Empirica Adds |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Task management | Epistemic goals with measurable completion |
| Plan mode | Investigation phase with Sentinel gating — no edits until understanding is verified |
| MEMORY.md | Auto-curated hot cache ranked by epistemic confidence |
| Context window | 4-layer memory that survives compaction and persists across sessions |
| Code editing | Grounded calibration — was the AI's confidence justified by test results? |
| Subagent spawning | Bounded autonomy with delegated work counting and budget tracking |

The result: Claude Code's native capabilities, enhanced with measurement, gating, and calibration feedback that compounds over time.

## Cross-AI Mesh

Empirica isn't just per-session measurement — multiple Claude sessions across projects can coordinate as peers. The mesh runs on top of [Empirica Cortex](https://getempirica.com) (proprietary serving layer):

```
empirica AI ──cortex_propose──► ECO Accept/Decline ──► outreach AI wakes
                                                             │
                                       cortex_complete_proposal (commit SHA)
                                                             │
empirica AI wakes ◄─────── outbox/completed event ───────────┘
```

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|-------------|
| **`cortex_propose` (two flavors)** | `collab_brief` is auto-accepted (FYI / question / discussion). Code change / architecture / investigation requests are **ECO-gated** — they wait for an Accept/Decline decision before the target AI acts |
| **`empirica mailbox reply`** | One verb does `cortex_propose` + `cortex_complete_proposal` atomically — closes the AI-to-AI handshake in a single step instead of two |
| **Persistent listener service** | systemd-user / launchd daemon holds an ntfy stream open. Idle sessions wake the moment a peer's proposal is decided, not on next user prompt |
| **Canonical loops** | `cortex-mailbox-poll` (30s adaptive) and `message-cleanup` (daily git-notes prune) auto-install per AI — no per-project config needed |

The browser-side ECO surface (Accept/Decline, inbox triage, publish review) lives in the proprietary [Empirica Extension](https://getempirica.com).

## Practice Model + Entity Graph (1.10.0)

Empirica's workspace stores entities (projects, contacts, organisations, engagements, users) in `entity_registry` with typed edges in `entity_memberships`. The **Practice Model** frames this consistently:

| Term | Maps to |
|------|---------|
| **Practitioner** | the AI working on the project (you) |
| **Practice** | the empirica project itself |
| **Agent** | a subagent spawned during the work |

Four CLI verbs query the graph without raw SQL:

```bash
empirica entity-list [--type project|contact|organization|engagement|user]
empirica entity-show <type:id>          # full record + incoming/outgoing edges
empirica entity-walk <type:id> --depth 3 # BFS membership graph, cycle-safe
empirica entity-search "query" [--type T]
```

All read-only, all support `--output json`. Backs cross-project orchestration, CRM workflows, and the entity-aware POSTFLIGHT retrospective.

## What's New in 1.10.4

- **Windows: every hook failed on every event — fixed (#111)** — `setup-claude-code` now writes forward-slash hook paths (Git Bash was eating the backslashes)
- **Listener replay storms fixed** — `loop_fires.log` rotates by rename, so the wake-Monitors stop re-firing duplicate events across the mesh
- **`gh run`/`gh workflow` reads un-gated** in the Sentinel — CI-status checks no longer need a CHECK gate
- **Decay recency extended to lessons + eidetic** — the read-time recency rerank now covers lessons + eidetic facts (longevity modulator), not just findings
---

## Privacy & Data

**Your data stays local:**

- `.empirica/` — Local SQLite database (gitignored by default)
- `.git/refs/notes/empirica/*` — Epistemic checkpoints (local unless you push)
